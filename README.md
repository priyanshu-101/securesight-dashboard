## üèó Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- MySQL database (local, Docker, or cloud)
- Git

### 1. Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/priyanshu-101/securesight-dashboard.git
cd securesight-dashboard
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Setup
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
```bash
MYSQL_HOST=your_mysql_host
MYSQL_PORT=3306
MYSQL_USER=your_mysql_user
MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
MYSQL_DATABASE=securesight_db
```

### 4. Database Setup
```bash
# Create database and tables
mysql -u your_user -p your_database < schema.sql

# Seed with sample data
npm run seed
```

### 5. Run Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the dashboard.

### 6. Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## üì° API Endpoints

### Incidents
- `GET /api/incidents?resolved=false` - Get incidents (filtered by resolved status)
- `PATCH /api/incidents/:id/resolve` - Toggle incident resolved status

## üéØ Tech Decisions

### **Database Choice: MySQL**
- Chose MySQL for its robust relational capabilities and wide deployment support
- Used connection pooling for better performance under load
- Implemented proper foreign key relationships for data integrity

### **Frontend Architecture: Next.js App Router**
- App Router for better performance and developer experience
- Server-side rendering for improved SEO and initial load times
- TypeScript for better code quality and development experience

### **State Management: React Hooks**
- Used built-in React state management for simplicity
- Implemented optimistic UI updates for better user experience
- Custom hooks for reusable logic

### **3D Implementation: React Three Fiber**
- Chose R3F for seamless React integration
- Environment mapping and realistic lighting
- Responsive controls with OrbitControls

### **Styling: Tailwind CSS**
- Utility-first approach for rapid development
- Consistent design system
- Dark theme implementation for security monitoring context
